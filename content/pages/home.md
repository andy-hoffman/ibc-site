      The Indiana Buddhist Center serves the people of central Indiana and
      beyond by being a local source of accurate information on the religion and
      philosophy of Buddhism in the lineage of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama.
      The Center serves as a place of teaching, practice, meditation and
      friendship for Indiana Buddhists and those who are interested in learning
      about the Dharma. The Center engages in events that further the
      understanding of Buddhist philosophy in the form of regular teachings and
      special events. Currently, IBC offers Buddhist teachings, prayer and
      chanting sessions and meditations. We are very fortunate to have Geshe
      Jinpa Sonam as a resident teacher. Please check our schedule for dates and
      times. Our Center follows in the tradition of His Holiness the Dalai Lama.
      In 2016, we were very fortunate that his holiness visited the Center, and
      gave a teaching and blessing.
